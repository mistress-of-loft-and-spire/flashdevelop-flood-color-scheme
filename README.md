# Flood syntax color scheme for Flashdevelop
My favorite color scheme for use in FlashDevelop, works for haxe and as3.


Based on this [as3 syntax color scheme](http://blog.codestage.ru/2011/04/05/flashdevelop-as3-syntax-coloring-scheme/) by Dmitriy Yukhanov (focus).

Based on another color scheme by unknown.
If you know the original author or name of this theme let me know.

## Installation

1. Download the `syntax.fdz` file and open it up (or drag and drop into FlashDevelop).
2. FlashDevelop will install it automatically!
3. Restart FlashDevelop.
4. Done!

You can also manually add it via `Tools â†’ Select UI Theme....` or by downloading the .xml files and copying them to your FlashDevelop `Language` folder.
